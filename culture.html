            <h3>Indonesia’s Culture</h3>
            <p>Indonesia’s culture is a vibrant blend of diverse ethnic traditions, languages, and religious influences, 
                shaped by its over 17,000 islands and centuries of interaction with other civilizations. 
                The country is home to more than 300 ethnic groups, each with unique customs, dances, clothing, and art forms. 
                While Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, it also embraces religious diversity, with significant 
                populations of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and practitioners of indigenous beliefs.
                 Traditional arts like wayang (shadow puppetry), gamelan music, and batik fabric-making remain central to cultural expression. Family values, respect for elders, and a strong sense of community play a vital role in daily life. Despite its diversity, Indonesia maintains a strong national identity through the motto “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” — “Unity in Diversity.”</p>
